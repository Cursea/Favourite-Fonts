# Favourite-Fonts
Chingu solo project: modern web app 

The task was to clone a font selecting website, as seen here: https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier1-favfonts

The initial spec included the full HTML/CSS design of the site, basic JS functionality, responsiveness (portrait, landscape, small/large), a dark mode and list view toggle.
